Introduction:
-------------

The idea of this data research is to find trends among all the sites present on Stack Exchange Network. 

I have tried to take into account the various SE sites which are present and how much content is getting generated and how are the users using that content. A major focus of my study is how the stack network has grown since its inception and which sites have significantly contributed towards the growth of the SE Network.

I have tried to visualize the date in terms of motion charts to see how the activity has changed on the SE network for each of the websites.

Relationship between top tags:
---------------------------------
Working example at: http://ec2-50-17-90-141.compute-1.amazonaws.com/Kaggle/topTagRelations.html

!["Top 10 Tag Relationships"](https://github.com/napsternxg/Kaggle-StackOverflow-Vis/raw/master/Images/TagRelationShip.png "Top 10 Tag Relationships")

!["Top 20 Tag Relationships"](https://github.com/napsternxg/Kaggle-StackOverflow-Vis/raw/master/Images/Top20TagRelationShip.png "Top 20 Tag Relationships")

As we can see tags of similar technology have a very high relationship e.g. **php-mysql, HTML-jquery-javascript, objective-c > iphone and c#-asp.net**

Data of Stack Exchange Network
-------------------------------

I have also taken a closer look at the data hosted on the stack exchange network related to the density of interaction on its various sister sites.

Here are some info graphics which clearly point out which are the most used websites on the network and how are the various types of interactions divided:

**The interactive visualization for the below image can be found at: http://ec2-50-17-90-141.compute-1.amazonaws.com/Kaggle/index.html**


!["Stack Exchange Site Wide Split"](https://github.com/napsternxg/Kaggle-StackOverflow-Vis/raw/master/Images/StackExchangeSiteWiseSplit.png "Stack Exchange Site Wide Split")

The above info graphic tells us that the amount of interactions are more or less same on all sites. Some sites stand out as clear winners in terms of the ratio of the questions asked to answered.

Below is a more comparitive study in terms of **Questions, Answers, Comments and Tags*** on each of the sites.

**PS: I have purposely removed stack overflow from the following visualizations as its data is already a lot more in comparison to other websites hence to make the visualization easy to read. I have simply included all other sites except stack overflow**

Country Based Split of Users for Stack Overflow
-----------------------------------------------

This is something which I feel is useful and is specific to stack overflow as I have tried to map the various countries based on the density of their user activity. The infographic shows that some countries are still not using stack overflow.

Comparison of Computer Related and Non Computer Related Sites
--------------------------------------------------------------

In particular I have made a comparitive study of top sites among the 2 kinds of sites on SE network viz. computer science related and non-computer science related.

The interesting realizations have been that the non-cs sites also generate an equal amount of traffic however there are many fluctuations in the same for non cs as compared to the usual cs sites on SE.

Following are some images of the growth of the CS and non CS sites on SE network. [I have only considered the top sites in each category]:

**The interactive visualization for the below images can be found at: http://ec2-50-17-90-141.compute-1.amazonaws.com/Kaggle/motionNonCS_SE.html**


Here are the data for the top Non CS sites on SE Network:

Also below are similar data for some of the top CS sites on SE Network:

Top Tags on Stack Overflow
--------------------------

Tags are important way of categorizing information on stack exchange sites so here I have tried to visualize the life cycle of the current top tags on  stack overflow:

**The interactive visualization for the same can be found at: http://ec2-50-17-90-141.compute-1.amazonaws.com/Kaggle/topTagsMotion.html**

!["Life Cycle of Top Tags on Stack Overflow"](https://github.com/napsternxg/Kaggle-StackOverflow-Vis/raw/master/Images/TopTagsCountGrowthMonthWise.PNG "Life Cycle of Top Tags on Stack Overflow")

Also here is the total tag count in the current month. A more interesting infographic can be looked at my full code which shows a motion chart detailing how each tag grew on stack overflow.

Questions and Answers on Stack Overflow
---------------------------------------

Here I have analyzed the growth of Questions and answers on stack overflow on a per month basis since its start.
